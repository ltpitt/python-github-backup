# Python GitHub Backup
Python script to backup all repositories from a specific user

# Installation
* **Python** (<3) is required. If you have Linux or Mac you should be good to go and you should skip to the next step, if you're on Windows and you like lazy'n'great you can install Python with a couple clicks from: http://ninite.com
* Clone the repository or simply download it as a zip file and unzip it in your local folder

If you don't use `pipsi`, you're missing out.
Here are [installation instructions](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/pipsi#readme).

Simply run:

    $ git clone https://github.com/ltpitt/python-github-backup.git
    $ cd python-github-backup
    $ pipsi install .

If you do not use pipsi then use pip:

    $ pip install .

# Usage
