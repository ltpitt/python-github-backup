# GitHub Backup
Python script to backup all GitHub repositories for the specified user.  
It will also take care of rotation of backups and of their retention period.

## Installation
* **Python** (<3) is required. If you have Linux or Mac you should be good to go and you should skip to the next step, if you're on Windows and you like lazy'n'great you can install Python with a couple clicks from: http://ninite.com
* Clone the repository or simply download it as a zip file and unzip it in your local folder

Now you have two choices: pip or pipsi.  

Pip is the classic choice.  
Here are [installation instructions](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).  

Once pip is installed, from the script folder:

    $ pip install .

The other option is pipsi.  
If you don't use `pipsi`, you're missing out.  
Here are [installation instructions](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/pipsi#readme).

Once pipsi is installed, from the script folder: 

    $ git clone https://github.com/ltpitt/python-github-backup.git
    $ cd python-github-backup
    $ pipsi install .


## Usage

To use it:

    $ github-backup --help
